    * Created the README.md file with placeholder info.
    * Created a code directory where my programs and libraries will be held.
    * Created this notebook file, where dated entries of work and progress will be held.

I began creating the clipped.py program. This program generates a sine wave WAV file with the following specs:

* Channels per frame: 1 (mono)
* Sample format: 16 bit signed (values in the range -32767..32767)
* Amplitude: Â¼ maximum possible 16-bit amplitude (values in the range -8192..8192)
* Duration: one second
* Frequency: 440Hz (440 cycles per second)
* Sample Rate: 48000 samples per second

I used the numpy and sciPy libraries to achieve this. I have little experience with the former,and no experience using the latter, but I found helpful info from these two links:
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48043004/how-do-i-generate-a-sine-wave-using-python
* https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.io.wavfile.write.html

Upon execution of the program, a wav file titled sine_wave.wav was added to the current directory. 

Takeaways:
* I desperately need to brush up on my knowledge of Python libraries and their corresponding usages and syntaxes. 

To-Do:
* Step 2 of the program specs, which is:
  * Extend the program to write a wave file called clipped.wav in the current directory. This file will consist of a 1/2-amplitude sine wave (values: -16384 to 16384). Samples that would be greater than 1/4 max amplitude should instead be maxed at 1/4 amplitude (8192), and those less than 1/4 min amplitude should be at -8192. Doing this will create a file where the Reaper (Audacity can suck it!) GUI displays it as a set of sine waves with their heads cut off.

It's been a while since the last entry in here. The last couple of weeks have been spent trying to understand the concepts presented in the class more comprehensively before trying my hand at coding again. Anyway, I created a program called audio_visualizer.py. This program allows a user to either load a file or generate a tone for a selected musical note. It uses the fft (fast Fourier transform) algorithm to display a visualization of the frequency spectrum of the chosen sound. To do this, I used matplotlib, scipy, and simpleaudio. Because I never worked with matplotlib before, I applied a lot of what I learned from the link: https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html

Here are my program functionalities so far:
* Audio generation: loads a wav file, converting it to mono if it is not natively stereo
* frequency spectrum visualization: converts the audio data from the time domain to the frequency domain using fft, focuses on a selected sound's frequency range, with a bandwidth range of +- 5 Hz, and updates the plot in real-time
* audio playback: plays the selected audio, synchronizing it with the visualizer

To Do:
* add a main function for the user interface
* create a function that allows the user to generate a tone from the spectrum of musical notes in the 4th octave
